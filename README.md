Coding exercises in Python / C++ / Go

- two number sum with list comprehension
Two Sum - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. 
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
 You can return the answer in any order.

# Purpose Statement
This repository does not represent my professional coding skills or production-level work. It serves as a personal playground and learning environment specifically designed for:

Competitive Programming Practice: Contains solutions to algorithmic challenges, coding contests, and practice problems that prioritize solving specific problems quickly rather than following best practices or creating maintainable code.
Interview Preparation Resources: Houses mind maps, notes, and reference materials that I use to refresh my knowledge before technical interviews.
Algorithm Exploration: Features implementations of various algorithms and data structures in different states of completion as I work through learning them.

# What You Will Find Here

Quick, sometimes unpolished solutions to coding challenges
Algorithm implementations focused on concept understanding
Mind maps and cheat sheets for quick review
Experimental code snippets without proper documentation
Solutions optimized for speed of execution or implementation rather than readability

# What This Repository Is Not

A showcase of my best work or coding practices
A representation of how I write production code
A complete or polished software project
Code intended for deployment in real-world applications
